# DistributedDynamicGraph

A lightweight Java application designed to simulate Remote Procedure Call (RPC) communications between distributed system components, focusing on dynamic graph operations.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic client-server architecture where clients can perform operations on a graph maintained by the server. The primary operations include:

- **Create**: Add new nodes to the graph.
- **Update**: Modify existing nodes.
- **Remove**: Delete nodes from the graph.

These operations are simulated through RPC calls, providing a foundational understanding of distributed graph management.

## Features

- **Client-Server Model**: Simulates interactions between clients and a central graph server.
- **Dynamic Graph Operations**: Supports creation, updating, and deletion of graph nodes.
- **Educational Purpose**: Serves as a learning tool for understanding RPC communications in distributed systems.

## Project Structure

- `.idea/`: Contains project-specific settings for IntelliJ IDEA.
- `alexu/edu/eg/`: Contains the core Java source files and logic for the distributed graph system.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `ds.iml`: IntelliJ IDEA module file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)

### Running the Application
